Some small video processing utilities made while shadowing a Swarthmore Alum. 

=> frameExtract.py - a graphical script for extracting images from a video 
   at a given timestamp.

=> ChangeDetect/fChange.py - a script for detecting timestamps of changes
   in a video. See the separate README for running instructions and 
   command line arguments.
